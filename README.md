# Parablic-reflector-antenna


Parabolic Reflector has been designed for different frequencies of 2.5 GHz and 7.5
GHz.
This has a fixed radius of 0.029979 and focal length of 0.01499. After the simulation, it is
determined that gain is directly proportional to frequency.
7.5 GHz has more gain than 2.5 GHz.



Parabolic reflector antenna is designed with a fixed frequency of 10GHz with a
varying radius of 0.05 m, 0.075 m, 0.1 m. After simulating, it was observed that the
highest radius of 0.1 m has the highest gain. It is concluded that radius and gain
are directly proportional in a fixed frequency setting.
